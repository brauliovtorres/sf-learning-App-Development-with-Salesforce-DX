# App Development with Salesforce DX

[Use the Salesforce command-line interface to create, convert, and deploy apps.](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_app_dev)

## Hands-On
- To get started, log in to the Dev Hub using the CLI, so youâ€™re authorized to create scratch orgs. `sfdx auth:web:login`
- To authorize the Dev Hub, use the web login flow: `sfdx auth:web:login -d -a <your-devhub-alias>`
- Adding the `-d` flag sets this org as the default Dev Hub. Use the `-a` flag to set an alias for the org (something catchy like DevHub).

### Create a Scratch Org
- In a command window, navigate to where you want your project located.
- Create the project: `sfdx force:project:create -n <your-project-name>`
- In the command window, change to the `<your-project-name>` project directory.
- Create a scratch org with the alias <your-scratchorg-alias> `sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a <your-scratchorg-alias>`
- The `-s` option indicates that you want this scratch org to be the default org for this project when running Salesforce CLI commands. To use a different org on a per command basis, you can specify the `-u` argument and specify another alias.
- The `-f` option is the path to the project scratch org configuration file.
- The `-a` option refer to the org using its alias.

### Create Sample Data
- Create the Marriott Marquis account.
  `sfdx force:data:record:create -s Account -v "Name='Marriott Marquis' BillingStreet='780 Mission St' BillingCity='San Francisco' BillingState='CA' BillingPostalCode='94103' Phone='(415) 896-1600' Website='www.marriott.com'"`

- Create the Hilton Union Square account.
  `sfdx force:data:record:create -s Account -v "Name='Hilton Union Square' BillingStreet='333 O Farrell St' BillingCity='San Francisco' BillingState='CA' BillingPostalCode='94102' Phone='(415) 771-1400' Website='www.hilton.com'"`

- Create the Hyatt account.
  `sfdx force:data:record:create -s Account -v "Name='Hyatt' BillingStreet='5 Embarcadero Center' BillingCity='San Francisco' BillingState='CA' BillingPostalCode='94111' Phone='(415) 788-1234' Website='www.hyatt.com'"`

- In your Salesforce DX project, create a directory called `data`
  `mkdir data`

- Export some sample data.
  `sfdx force:data:tree:export -q "SELECT Name, BillingStreet, BillingCity, BillingState, BillingPostalCode, Phone, Website FROM Account WHERE BillingStreet != NULL AND BillingCity != NULL and BillingState != NULL" -d ./data`

### Validate Your App
- Create a new scratch org: `sfdx force:org:create -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a <your-test-org>`

- Open your org: `sfdx force:org:open -u <your-test-org>`
- Test the Account Locator tab, and verify that it works as expected. From the App Launcher, find and select Account Locator.
